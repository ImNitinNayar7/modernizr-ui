# Modernizr UI

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have all the prerequisites installed
	+ `npm install -g webpack`
	+ `npm install -g bower`

2. Load the dependencies into your project
	+ `npm install && bower install`

3. Start the task runners (NOTE: Webpack does not use Grunt task at the moment, due to speed)
	+ `grunt watch`
	+ `npm start`

4. Load an HTTP server of your choice
	+ e.g. `npm install -g http-server && http-server'
